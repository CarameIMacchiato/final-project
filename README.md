Okay, actually to get people to be sandbox users, I have to invite them and then they have to go to https://instagram.com/developer and sign up for a developer account.
They can use random info, but once they're signed up, they have to click on 'Sandbox Invites' on the top right corner and accept the invitation there.

h1(Instatistics)

h4(What is it?)

Instatistics is an application that uses the Instagram API to get information on its users. It was designed to have the user look at their account's statistics, such as what filters they use, their average amount of likes or comments, and the locations that they've taken their photos in. One major element of this app is the ability to compare to users, side by side.

h4(Usage)

Because this is an application in Sandbox Mode, users only have access to 10 pre-selected users. To use the app, type in any of the available usernames in the text search boxes and the app will update the page with their account information.
